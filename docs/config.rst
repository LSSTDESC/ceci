Pipeline YAML Files
===================

The list of which steps to run in a pipeline, the overall inputs for it, execution information, and directories for output, are all defined in a configuration file in the YAML format.

Here is an example, from test/test.yml:


.. code-block:: yaml

  # There are currently three defined launchers
  # mini, parsl, and cwl
  launcher:
      name: mini
      interval: 0.5
  # and three sites:
  # local, cori, and cori-interactive
  site:
      name: local
      max_threads: 2


  # The list of stages to run and the number of processors
  # to use for each.
  stages:
      - name: WLGCSummaryStatistic
        nprocess: 1
      - name: SysMapMaker
        nprocess: 1
      - name: shearMeasurementPipe
        nprocess: 1
      - name: PZEstimationPipe
        nprocess: 1
      - name: WLGCRandoms
        nprocess: 1
      - name: WLGCSelector
        nprocess: 1
      - name: SourceSummarizer
        nprocess: 1
      - name: WLGCTwoPoint
        nprocess: 1
      - name: WLGCCov
        nprocess: 1

  # Definitions of where to find inputs for the overall pipeline.
  # Any input required by a pipeline stage that is not generated by
  # a previous stage must be defined here.  They are listed by tag.
  inputs:
      DM: ./test/inputs/dm.txt
      fiducial_cosmology: ./test/inputs/fiducial_cosmology.txt

  # Overall configuration file 
  config: ./test/config.yml

  # If all the outputs for a stage already exist then do not re-run that stage
  resume: False

  # Put all the output files in this directory:
  output_dir: ./test/outputs

  # Put the logs from the individual stages in this directory:
  log_dir: ./test/logs
